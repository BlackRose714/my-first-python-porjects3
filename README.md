# 🎓 Student Grade Calculator - Python Project

This is a basic but structured Python project that calculates a student's course grades based on their midterm and final exam scores. It supports multiple departments, and automatically loads relevant courses for each.

The project has two versions:
- *Long Version (Without Functions)* – Raw, repetitive, but educational.
- *Short Version (With Functions)* – Cleaner, reusable, and modular.

---

## 📌 Purpose

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate:
- How a repetitive and manual codebase can be improved using *functions*
- How project organization and readability evolves with experience
- How a simple logic can be reused across different cases

---

## 📚 Supported Departments and Courses

Currently, the program supports the following departments:

| Department                | Courses                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Çocuk Gelişim (Child Dev) | Anne ve Çocuk Sağlığı, Çocuk Beslenmesi, Çocuk Gelişimi, İstatistik     |
| Bilgisayar Programcılığı  | Programlama Temelleri, VTYS, Matematik, Grafik Tasarımı                 |
| Sosyal Hizmetler          | Sosyoloji, Sosyal Güvenlik, İnsan Davranışı ve Sosyal Çevre, SH Kuramları |

## 🧮 How It Works

1. The program first asks for the *student's name* and *department*.
2. Based on the department, it automatically loads the list of relevant courses.
3. Then it asks for the *midterm and final* exam scores for each course.
4. It calculates the *weighted average* (30% midterm + 70% final).
5. Based on the result, a *letter grade* is assigned.

## ✨ Why Two Versions?

I deliberately created *two versions* of the same project to showcase the learning process:

- 🔹 The *long version* is useful to understand the logic step by step, ideal for beginners.
- 🔹 The *short version* reflects what happens when we start thinking in reusable structures (functions), and is much easier to maintain.

This also helps show the *before/after* effect in real code development.

## 📈 Next Steps

In future updates, I might:
- Add exception handling for invalid inputs
- Add GUI version using tkinter or PyQt
- Store data in .csv or database

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- The importance of *code reusability*
- Using *functions* to clean up repeated logic
- Structuring simple scripts like real-world mini projects
- Planning and documenting in a way others can understand
